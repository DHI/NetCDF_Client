# NetCDF_Client
This program converts structured grid NetCDF and GRIB2 files with CF convention (http://cfconventions.org) to MIKE DFS files and vice versa.

Other NetCDF files which are non-compliant with CF convention will not work, however additional modifications are possible to enable the conversion of non CF convention NetCDF files to DFS files on a request basis. For such requests, please contact mike@dhigroup.com.

This tool is developed for MIKE Powered by DHI 2017 and is not actively maintained. If you find this tool beneficial to your work and would like to contribute to the code, please contact me at czc@dhigroup.com


*Important - Please unzip the file "netcdfAll-4.5.exe.7z" in the 3rd folder before compiling. It is zipped as it exceeded the 25mb file limite from GitHub.*
